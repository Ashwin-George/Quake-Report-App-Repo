# Quake-Report-App-Repo
This is a EarthQuake Reporting app
I have made this app using concepts like JSON parsing, Http Request ,etc.
This show a list of earthquakes sorted by order of Magnitude or time of occurence as per user choice.
I have made this app by learning from platform Udacity course: Networking:Android Basics
Please have a look at it and please tell me how can i improve on the application. ðŸ˜€
